# Tiffany Hrabusa's Writing Portfolio
Welcome! This repository contains samples of my written work.

## Who I am
I am a writer and information professional. After earning my MLIS degree, I spent more than a decade conducting complex conflict searches, performing detailed legal research, and mastering multiple, ever-changing technologies. 

I have since earned a [Technical Communication certificate from UC Berkeley](https://extension.berkeley.edu/public/category/courseCategoryCertificateProfile.do?method=load&certificateId=17211&selectedProgramAreaId=15550&selectedProgramStreamId=15615) and am contributing to open-source projects as a technical writer and editor.

## What I do
I connect stakeholders to data and information. My job is to produce and provide information that is well organized and well written. I find the gaps and fill them. I recognize the inaccuracies and correct them. I write for my audience and guide them.

This repository includes sample writing pieces that demonstrate what I can do. The [expository](/expository/) folder contains research-based work that explains a topic. The [instructional](/instructional/) folder contains task-oriented and educational material, and the [persuasive](/persuasive/) folder holds papers written to convince the audience to take action.

## How I do it
I never stop learning. By making myself the student, time and time again, I know exactly how it feels to study a topic as a novice. I understand how uncertainty impedes understanding and how frustration with poorly written documentation bars learning. I approach every writing project with empathy based on my own personal experience, and I strive to clarify complex concepts and hasten information uptake.

## Why I do it
As a technical communicator, I donâ€™t want to just create content. I want to aid understanding and eliminate confusion. I want my words to help someone complete a task or accomplish a goal.
