## [Theoretical white paper (2023)](2023_theoretical_white_paper.pdf)
Written for the Berkeley technical communication program, this white paper aimed to convince a large social media company to voluntarily integrate its systems via an API with a non-governmental organization to collect evidence of human rights atrocities. I created the graphs using Tableau and the diagrams using Lucidchart.

## [Instructional design plan (2019)](2019_instructional_design_plan.pdf)
I presented this design plan to a previous employer to persuade them to adopt a new staff training program.
