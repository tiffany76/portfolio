# Instructional Writing

My instructional writing samples can be found in this folder.

## Partial style guide (2023)
I produced this subsection of a style guide for my technical communication certificate program.

## Elementary school handout (2022)
Intended for an audience of school children, this handout is another course project from my writing certificate program. It explains how hurricanes form.

## Lexis Advance user guide rewrite (2018)
I created this partial rewrite of a PDF software user guide for a technical writing course. Using minimalist principles, it includes task and reference topics.
